# ChromisStock
Android based Stock Control app for ChromisPOS

The application is designed to be an offline stock management system for ChromisPOS and potentially other POS systems
such as unicentaPOS.

Stock data is downloaded to a local database on an Android device and can be viewed and changed before uploading changes
to the main ChromisPOS database.

Uses include adding new stock during shopping trips or upon delivery at a location and for performing stocktaking.

The current release only works with ChromisPOS databases and does not support changing data.

Barcode reading is supported by external applications, a suitable application that uses the camera can be installed
from within the application.
